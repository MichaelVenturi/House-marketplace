# House Marketplace with TypeScript
Part of a React Udemy course, this is a mobile-first application using Firebase that allows users to create listings for houses on sale.  Users can create an account manually with their email or through Google OAuth.  
Unlike the course, I decided to upgrade to TypeScript for this project so I would have room to do some things a little differently.  Deployed to Vercel [here](https://house-marketplace-icypsdg9d-michael-venturis-projects.vercel.app/)
